# What are the Chances of That?
### Five reasons that we find it hard to think about uncertainty
## by Andrew C. A. Elliott

___What are the Chances of That?___ is a new book from the author of _Is That a Big Number?_. It will be published by Oxford University Press in 2021, and will be available from all good booksellers (details to come).

Here's an idea of what the book contains:

---

## Introduction - Living in an Uncertain World
Understanding chance can be a matter of life and death - five dualities that confuse us when we think about uncertainty - what this book is NOT - what this book IS - the language we use to talk about chance - Ways to show chance.

### Reckoning the Chances
Rolling the bones - quantifying chance - Cardano, Fermat, Pascal, Huygens, Bernoulli - what took them so long?
### Random Thoughts
What is randomness? - quantum - entropy - generating randomness - the continuous casino.
### Patterns of Probability
Kinds of randomness - counting the ways - how long to wait? - what is normal? - models and reality.
