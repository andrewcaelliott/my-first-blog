Dear ***

{Why you?}

We started IsThatABigNumber.com earlier this year with one simple aim: to help promote numeracy by providing ways of comparing numbers against a set of meaningful and engaging comparisons. For example:

* The turnover of Apple is about the same as the GDP of Vietnam.
* The Yankee Stadium has twice as many seats as there are Polar Bears in the wild.
* The East-West "width" of Australia is 1000 times the length of NYC's Central Park.
* The Three Gorges Dam holds 10 times the water that Lake Zurich does.
* We've now had radio technology about 1/5 as long as we've had print technology.

The audience we had in mind was a wide one. A "natural" audience, would be those involved in education whether as learners or teachers, but also journalists and other commentators, politicians and other people in public life. 

In short, we'd love to engage with anyone for whom it is important to understand that a billion dollars is not just a little bit bigger than a million dollars, and that, for example, a high-profile country like Sweden has 1/5 the population of a low-profile country like the Sudan but more than 7 times the GDP.

This has been a labour of love, driven by a belief that, rather than shouting abuse at the television, it is better to do something that can, even in a small way, make things better.  

And there has been a wonderful response. Teachers have used IsThatABigNumber.com in classes, and we've had feedback from around the world that has been hugely positive. But there is much more that can be done to deliver more content, in better and more engaging ways.

With a little self-funded promotion, we now see around 100 visitors a day, many spending relatively long periods on the website, clearly engaging with the content (one vistor called it "addictive"!) . And that is wonderful, but of course there is a cost. Although hosting a website can be done cheaply, it's still not free. And it takes time and effort to maintain and develop. It would be wonderful to be able to fund a more aggressive promotional campaign.

That is why I am writing to ask you to consider a modest sponsorship for IsThatABigNumber.com. We are offering 25 subscription slots, each for $1000. 
Sponsorship will last for a year, and will entitle you to:
* Promotion via a display block on the website masthead (displaying 1 sponsor at a time),
* Inclusion on a list of "our sponsors",
* Our sincere gratitude,
* A warm feeling that you have done one more thing to fight the innumeracy and irrationality of our times.

We will use the funds raised in this way to maintain and develop the website and to boost our promotional campaign with social media advertising.

Please help us in our efforts. Wouldn't we all rather live in a world where influencers and decision-makers really understood the numbers around us?

Thank you for your attention.
